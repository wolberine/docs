our customers have often found that certain carriers have blocked the

to have an iPhone that is unlocked but the procedure described in this

This is the process for changing the APN
settings on iOS running on an unlocked iPhone (iOS 6 and up), which will
place the iPhone on the Hologram cellular network:
